  Imagine you run a used car dealership. Your particular niche is selling
  cars of the color red. But they must also be fairly new and reliable.
  So besides being red, you want the current owner to live in certain
  geographical regions, regions that provide good living conditions for
  cars (e.g. no winterish kind of places), and you want the cars to be
  less than five years old. But there is one exception, if it's a convertible,
  the only restriction that applies is that it still must be red.
